            <h1>Learning as a software developer and a graphic designer.</h1><br>
            <p>My name is Ankit and right now I am a class 12th science student. I will be pursuing a Bachelor's degree
                in Computer Science. I am learning about web development and am interested in creating web-based
                applications with a strong emphasis on simplicity and usability.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I am currently gaining knowledge and experience in javascript and Python, In the future I will go for
                React and Next.js for the front and Node.js and Flask for the backend.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I am passionate about open-source and enjoy exploring and learning from open-sourced repositories. I
                also contribute to them whenever I can. Additionally, I prefer to keep my own projects open-sourced.
